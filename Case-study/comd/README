Sequence of commands to obtain expected and actual SDC coverage:
1.  python3 getExpectedSDCCoverage.py
2.  To get actual SDC-coverage with Peppa-X generated input after protecting most vulnerable instruction sets obtained from knapsack run with the program default-input, run the following:
	python3 getActualSDCCoverage.py <optimal instruction sets from step 1> <FI-simulated data folder path> <Number of FI subfolder> <FI trials in each subfolder>

	Sample Command: python3 getActualSDCCoverage.py Result/optimal_instruction_sets.txt FI-result/comd--x-13--y-13--z-18--N-17 6 167


Note: see the expected and actual SDC coverage in 'Result' folder
