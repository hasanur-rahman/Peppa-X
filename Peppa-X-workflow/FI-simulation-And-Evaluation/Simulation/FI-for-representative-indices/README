This step runs the fault-injection trials for the small FI input with representative static instructions set of a benchmark  obtained from step two(Pruning FI space) of Peppa-X workflow in order to calculate to per-instruction sdc-rate which is needed by Genetic engine in the next step of the workflow.  

This step require three things to run:
	1. a llvm3.4 compiled IR file for the benchmark and should be put in the 'base' directory
	2. Modify the runFiForIndex.py script's defined variables with appropriate benchmark's parameter
	3. an representative instructions list "index_list.txt" obtained from step two of Peppa-X workflow.


Sample command:
		python3 runFiForIndex.py
