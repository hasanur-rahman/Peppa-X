To inject fault injection, one can run the following command:
    python runFi.py <benchmark> <program input>

Here, <benchmark> should be one of the following:
"pathfinder"
"needle"
"comd"
"hpccg"
"particlefilter"
"fft"
"xsbench"

sample command:
    python runFi.py "pathfinder" "50 20"
    
Note: llvm-IR file should be present in this directory. In the above example, it is "pathfinder.ll"

Also, one can set the number of fault-injections inside "input.yaml" file.
