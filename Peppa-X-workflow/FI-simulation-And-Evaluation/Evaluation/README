This step evaluates / calculates sdc-rate for the representatives instructions from the FI-simulation data for small FI input of a benchmark.

In order to evaluate, do the following:
	1. go to a benchmark folder
	2. run the getClusterFailureRates.py script with the following parameters:
		python3 getClusterFailureRates.py <FI-simulation data folder path> <Benchmark name> <Number of representative instructions> <Max number of FI-simulation per representative instructions>
